## To try it out, I recommend the Five-Server (Live Server) extension in VS Code.
Create these folders:
- img (with all .png files)
- css (with all css files)
- js (with all js files)
- lang (with all .json files)

All .html files remain in the main directory.
I'm new to GitHub, I don't know how to create folders here.

I didn't use AI, but I made an exception for the language system (German and English) and code formatting.
